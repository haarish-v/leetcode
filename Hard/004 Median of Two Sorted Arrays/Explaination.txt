You're looking at an optimized solution for LeetCode #4: Median of Two Sorted Arrays.
This problem asks you to find the median of two sorted arrays, and this solution uses binary search to achieve an O(log(min(m, n))) time complexity, which is the most efficient possible.
________________________________________
🔷 Problem Summary
Given two sorted arrays A and B, your task is to:
•	Merge them conceptually (not literally).
•	Find the median of the combined sorted array.
•	The solution must be O(log(min(len(A), len(B))) in time.
________________________________________
✅ Example
A = [1, 3]
B = [2]
Output: 2.0

# Combined: [1, 2, 3] → Median is 2

def findMedianSortedArrays(self, A, B):
•	A function that takes two sorted arrays A and B.
________________________________________
m, n = len(A), len(B)
if m > n:
    A, B, m, n = B, A, n, m
•	Ensure A is the smaller array.
•	Why? We binary search on the smaller one for efficiency and correctness.
________________________________________
imin, imax, half_len = 0, m, (m + n + 1) // 2
•	We binary search in array A (range from 0 to m)
•	half_len is half of the total length. Used to balance partitions.
________________________________________
while imin <= imax:
•	Start binary search loop.
________________________________________
    i = (imin + imax) // 2
    j = half_len - i
•	Partition A at i, so partition B at j
•	Goal: max(left_part_A, left_part_B) <= min(right_part_A, right_part_B)
________________________________________
🔽 Edge cases handling with binary search:
    if i < m and B[j - 1] > A[i]:
        imin = i + 1  # i is too small
•	We need to move right in A to balance the partition.
________________________________________
    elif i > 0 and A[i - 1] > B[j]:
        imax = i - 1  # i is too big
•	We need to move left in A.

✅ Correct partition is found:
    else:

Handling left max:
    if i == 0: max_of_left = B[j - 1]
    elif j == 0: max_of_left = A[i - 1]
    else: max_of_left = max(A[i - 1], B[j - 1])
•	Find the maximum of left side across both partitions.
•	Be careful of index out-of-bounds: if i == 0, then left side of A is empty.
________________________________________
If total length is odd:
    if (m + n) % 2 == 1:
        return max_of_left
•	Just return the middle value.
________________________________________
Handling right min:
    if i == m: min_of_right = B[j]
    elif j == n: min_of_right = A[i]
    else: min_of_right = min(A[i], B[j])
•	For even-length case: take average of max-of-left and min-of-right.
________________________________________
Return median:
    return (max_of_left + min_of_right) / 2.0
•	Return the average of the two middle values.

🧪 Example Walkthrough
A = [1, 3]
B = [2]
•	m = 2, n = 1 → swap → A = [2], B = [1, 3]
•	half_len = 2
•	Binary search on A:
o	i = 0 → j = 2 → A[i] = 2, B[j - 1] = 3 → A[i] < B[j - 1] → i too small → move right
o	i = 1 → j = 1 → partitions valid:
	max_of_left = max(2, 1) = 2
	min_of_right = min(invalid, 3) = 3
	Median = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
But we don’t reach this example because [1, 3] and [2] doesn't require swapping in this direction. Either way, the logic is robust.
