Absolutely! Here's the beginner-friendly explanation for your LeetCode problem “Count Hills and Valleys in an Array” written just like your Two Sum breakdown — with full structure, line-by-line, word-by-word clarity, and a walkthrough.
________________________________________
💡 Problem Summary
You are given a list of integers called nums.
Your job is to count how many hills and valleys exist in the list:
•	A hill happens when a number is greater than both its neighbors.
•	A valley happens when a number is less than both its neighbors.
•	Ignore equal neighboring values — they can’t form a hill or valley.
For example:
nums = [2, 4, 1, 1, 6, 5] → Output should be 3.

🧑‍💻 Code
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countHillValley(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Remove consecutive duplicates
        filtered = [nums[0]]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:
                filtered.append(nums[i])
        
        # Step 2: Count hills and valleys
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, len(filtered) - 1):
            if filtered[i] > filtered[i - 1] and filtered[i] > filtered[i + 1]:
                count += 1  # Hill
            elif filtered[i] < filtered[i - 1] and filtered[i] < filtered[i + 1]:
                count += 1  # Valley
        
        return count

🧵 Line-by-Line & Word-by-Word Breakdown
________________________________________
from typing import List
•	This line allows us to use List[int] for type hinting — a way to say nums will be a list of integers.
________________________________________
class Solution:
•	class: Creates a blueprint — in LeetCode, your code must be inside a class called Solution.
•	Solution: The name of the class (don’t change it).
________________________________________
def countHillValley(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
•	def: We’re defining a function.
•	countHillValley: The name of the function. LeetCode calls this during testing.
•	self: Refers to the current object of the class. Needed in class methods.
•	nums: List[int]: The input — a list of integers.
•	-> int: This function will return a single integer.
________________________________________
filtered = [nums[0]]
•	We make a new list called filtered starting with the first element of nums.
•	Purpose: To remove consecutive duplicates.
________________________________________
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
•	A loop that runs from index 1 to the end.
•	We skip index 0 because it’s already added to filtered.
________________________________________
if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:
•	If the current number is not equal to the previous number…
•	That means it’s not a duplicate.
________________________________________
filtered.append(nums[i])
•	Add that non-duplicate number to the filtered list.
________________________________________
count = 0
•	Create a variable to store the number of hills and valleys.
________________________________________
for i in range(1, len(filtered) - 1):
•	Loop from the second to the second-last number.
•	Because the first and last elements can never be hills or valleys.
________________________________________
if filtered[i] > filtered[i - 1] and filtered[i] > filtered[i + 1]:
•	This checks:
👉 Is the number greater than both its neighbors?
👉 If yes → it's a hill.
________________________________________
count += 1
•	Increase the hill/valley count by 1.
________________________________________
elif filtered[i] < filtered[i - 1] and filtered[i] < filtered[i + 1]:
•	If the number is less than both its neighbors → it's a valley.
________________________________________
return count
•	After finishing the loop, return the total number of hills and valleys.
________________________________________
🧪 Example Walkthrough
nums = [2, 4, 1, 1, 6, 5]
Step 1: Remove consecutive duplicates
filtered = [2, 4, 1, 6, 5]
Step 2: Loop through and check:
•	i = 1 → 4 > 2 and 4 > 1 → hill → count = 1
•	i = 2 → 1 < 4 and 1 < 6 → valley → count = 2
•	i = 3 → 6 > 1 and 6 > 5 → hill → count = 3
→ Final Answer: 3

💭 Why This Approach?
Brute Force (❌):
•	Compare all combinations — slow and wasteful (O(n²)).
Current Method (✅):
•	1st pass: Filter out unnecessary duplicates (O(n))
•	2nd pass: Scan for hills and valleys (O(n))
🟢 Time Complexity: O(n)
🟢 Space Complexity: O(n) (because of filtered)
________________________________________
✅ Final Thoughts
This is a perfect example of:
•	Filtering noise before processing.
•	Understanding local comparisons.
•	Reducing time with smart preprocessing.
You're not only solving the problem — you're solving it well.
